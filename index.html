    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>There were shadows stirring in the pale firelight</p>
    <p>Not saying Jake Wells was super scarred or anything, but he was definitly shaking.</p>
    <p>Regardless, throwing a log on the fire brightened the room. The chill remained, hanging thick over the walls filled with bookshelves and discarded relics.</p>
    <p>Don't read the books.</p>
